Economist by :mortar_board: and a data scientist by :heart: 
:::

:::{#hero-heading}
As a graduate financial economist, I've acquired an extensive hypothesis–driven research and problem–solving expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and model development.

As a data science professional, I have experience in underpinning business decisions with useful insights, developing novel data-driven products, and maintaining data-related best-practices from a technical perspective.
